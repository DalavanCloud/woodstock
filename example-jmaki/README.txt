This module builds the jMaki example of the Woodstock JavaScript
library. Currently, there are 2 ways to build the module:

  1) From the command-line:
     - set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the install
       directory for JDK 1.5 or greater
     - cd <module_dir>
     - <install directory for ANT 1.6.5 or greater>/ant/bin/ant

  2) From within the Netbeans IDE

Note: This build depends on the jmaki module, which must be built
first.
