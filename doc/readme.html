<h2><a name="WhatAre"></a>What are the Woodstock Components?</h2>
<p>The Woodstock components are a set of general purpose UI components
that follow Sun Web Application Guidelines (to be supplied), and can be
used for
developing
web applications and portlets at Sun. The components are built on the <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/">JavaServer(TM) Faces
library</a>, a JSR standard technology for building web components with
Java.&nbsp; The components will work in any web container that complies
with Servlets 2.5, JSP 2.1, and JSF 1.2.&nbsp; Currently, only
GlassFish (Application Server 9) meets all these
requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; See <a href="../www/BuildYourself.htm#SWrequirements">Software
Requirements</a>.<br>
</p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<p>The Woodstock components are <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">available
in the Visual Web Pack plugin module for Netbeans 5.5</span>, but can
also be used standalone to
build web applications.&nbsp; This readme describes how to <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">build and</span> use the
standalone Woodstock components.</p>

You should first
get a good background in JavaServer Faces. Here are a few suggestions:

Once you know JSF, you need to decide how you want to build
your application. There are a few ways to do this, but this document
only discusses Netbeans. You can also use a text editor if you code
manually.&nbsp; You can also use the Visual Web Pack for Netbeans<span

<p>Netbeans 5.5 is recommended because of its source level
debugging, and full
featured editor for building web
applications. </p>
