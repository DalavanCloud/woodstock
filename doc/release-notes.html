    <li>Fixed a JS bug in addRemove that broke functionality in Firefox 4.
</ul>

<h1>Woodstock 4.0.2.6 JSF Components Release Notes</h1>

<h3>Changes added in 4.0.2.6</h3>
<ul><li>Fixed GlassFish issue #4020/#4234.  NPE was fired when client with
	user-agent without a version was used.</li>
    <li>Fixed Tree/TreeNode so they render *all* their children.  This enables
	non-visual components to be used within the tree (like Ajax zones,
	events objects, iterators, etc.).</li>
    <li>Fixed bug where embeded TreeNode image was placed as a child instead
	of a facet.</li>
    <li>Added initial support for Safari &amp; Chrome.</li>
    <li>Fixed Masthead rendering bug (was missing a <td>).</li>
    <li>Fixed GlassFish IT #: 10945.  This required that all cookie names be
	RFC 2109 compliant (no ':' or '/' characters... plus a few more).</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Changes added in 4.0.2.5</h3>
<ul><li>Source code cleanup.</li>
    <li>Changed version page style to use 100% of the width.  This was the
	design intent, but was only enforced in the past by having text that
	required more than the window width.  It now works with shorter text
	as well.</li>
    <li>Checked in a new non-S-shaped version of the version page background
	image.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug preventing HTML to be used in the version page
	copyrightString property.  It is important to be able to insert br's,
	b's and other important html tags for formatting purposes.  This
	property is expected to originate from the developer and should not
	require escaping by default.  IF the developer expects user-created
	content to be inserted here, it is now the developer's responsibility
	to escape this text.</li>
    <li>Fixed a couple 508-related alt text messages that were not I18N'd.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes added in 4.0.2.4</h3>
<ul><li>If no Woodstock-supported locales are specified, the locales supported
	by JSF (i.e. Application.getSupportedLocales()) are now used.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes added in 4.0.2.3</h3>
<ul><li>TabSet component now renders it's 'id', making JS easier --
	particularly JSF2 Ajax.</li>
    <li>ant targets added to the build files to publish maven artifacts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes added in 4.0.2.2</h3>
<ul><li>A security fix related to the ThemeServlet serving 404 pages was fixed.</li>
    <li>508 messages were added on some images that were not labeled causing
	their client-id's to be read by screen readers, which significantly
	impacted usuability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>IE7 Button width issue</h3>
When displayed in IE7, the button component might be rendered
with an incorrect width. This problem occurs when the button is placed
using absolute positioning.For example, Netbeans with
Visual Web Pack, uses absolute positioning to place components in Grid
Layout
Mode, and in such situation this problem could occur.<br>
<br>
IE7 expects a value to be specified for the width of buttons. If
a width attribute is not specified, the width is set to width:auto,
which results in the button's width being set to the entire available
width of the button's container element.&nbsp; For example, if the
button
style has left=130px then the button will start at 130px left and will
expand to the width of the &lt;body&gt;.<br>
<h4>Workarounds</h4>
There are several workarounds that can be used in the
developer's code to solve the problem.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Specify the width attribute for the button, or resize
the button in the IDE to make the IDE assign a width to the button.</li>
  <li>Use relative positioning instead of absolute positioning on
the button component.&nbsp; For example:<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">&lt;input name="Button2" style="position:relative; left:72px;top:18px" type="button" value="Button" /&gt;</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Enclose the button inside a div or span element to
restrict the available width to the div/span element's width. Remember
to
set the positioning for the div/span element.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML Example 1:&nbsp; Button inside a div tag<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">&lt;div style="position:absolute; left:72px; top:68px"&gt;<br>  &lt;input name="Button1" type="button" value="button" /&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML Example 2:&nbsp; Button inside span tag<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">&lt;span style="position:absolute; left:72px; top:68px"&gt;<br>  &lt;input name="Button1" type="button" value="button" /&gt;<br>&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
<ul>
  <li>In VWP IDE, drop the button into a Group Panel to put the
button inside a span tag.&nbsp; In this case no need to set the
positioning as IDE
sets the positioning for Group Panel.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>JSP Example:&nbsp;&nbsp; Button inside Group Panel component <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">&lt;webuijsf:panelGroup binding="#{Page1.groupPanel1}" id="groupPanel1" style="position:absolute; left:240px; top:168px"&gt;<br>  &lt;webuijsf:button binding="#{Page1.button1}" id="button1" text="Button"/&gt;<br>&lt;/webuijsf:panelGroup&gt;</pre>
