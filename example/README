This example application comes complete with source code and a pre-built
war file ready for deployment.  It is assumed that you have downloaded
the example.zip and extracted it to <example_dir>.  This README does NOT
apply if you have downloaded the entire woodstock source code distribution,
since the example is built with the woodstock component set.

Build the source
----------------

Build requirements:
  To build this example app, you must have the following installed on your system:

  - Woodstock JSF-based components 4.0 or greater
    You must install the components jar as well as "other" dependent jars.
        See the components' README for details.

  - ANT 1.6.5 or greater (www.apache.org)
    Alternatively, if you use Netbeans 5.5 or greater you can use the version of        ANT that is bundled with NB.

  - J2EE web container supporting Servlet Api 2.4 or greater, JSP 2.0 or greater    and JSF 1.2.  At this time, only Glassfish 9.0_01 UR1 b14 supports all these.
    Alternatively, if you use Netbeans* you can use the version of
        Appserver that is bundled with NB.



Build configuration:

  - Create the file <example_dir>/build.properties containing the following 3 properties:

    ant.home=<install directory for ANT 1.6.5 or greater>
            This can be the path to a seperate installation of ANT or
                the path to the ANT that is bundled with NB**.  If the former
                you will need to acquire a copy of "copyfiles.jar" that comes
                with NB and install it into <ant.home>/extra.

    components.home=<install directory for JSF-based components>

    container.lib=<path to the web container's "lib" directory>
            Thus can be the path to a seperate installation of a web container
                or the path to the version of Tomcat that is bundled with NB**.


   (** Note that these are private Netbeans paths and are subject to change.
       Use at your own risk.)

For example:  If you have ANT installed in /usr/local/ant, the woodstock
components installed in /files/woodstock, and your web container in /usr/glassfish, then your <example_dir>/build.properties would be:

ant.home=/usr/local/ant
components.home=/files/woodstock
container.lib=/usr/glassfish/lib



There are 2 ways to build the example:

  1) From the command-line:
     - set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the install
       directory for JDK 1.5 or greater
     - cd <example_dir>
     - <install directory for ANT 1.6.5 or greater>/ant/bin/ant

  2) From within the Netbeans IDE



Deployment
----------

You can deploy <example dir>/dist/example.war to any web container using
the mechanisms available for that container, or thru Netbeans.
