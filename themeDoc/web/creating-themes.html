<h1><a name="5"></a>5 Creating a Theme</h1>
<p>
Creating a theme is a very difficult and time consuming task. There are
a large number of CSS selectors, images, Javascript files, and HTML 
templates that are
all interrelated. A change to one can have undesirable effects on
another. For example a CSS selector definition and Javascript
may be dependent on the HTML used to represent a component. It might be that
the only way to effect a particular look is to change the HTML in addition
to the CSS. This can be problematic for many of the Woodstock
components because the HTML exists in JSF renderers written in Java.
The HTML is written to the response programmatically. To change the
rendered HTML, a subclass
of the component's Renderer must be created and configured in the JSF
render kit, and associated to a particular component. The details
necessary for performing this level of customization is beyond
the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>
Some components are rendered using
"widget" renderers which depend on an HTML template file that defines the
HTML for the component. But many of these templates are sparse and 
generic and most of the document construction happens 
programmatically in Javascript, which depends on the HTML structure
in the template. Changing these templates is beyond the
scope of this document.
However the techniques described in this document can be used to "override"
the default HTML template, if only cosmetic changes to the template
are needed and do not interfere with the logic implemented in 
Javascript.
</p>
<p>
There are a large number of images that are tightly bound to colors
used in the CSS selector definitions. A seemingly simple color change
to a CSS selector definition, may not be sufficient since there
may be an image defined as part of that selector that needs to be
modified to reflect the new color.
</p>
<p>
Even changing font size may result in layout problems because the
branding design of the HTML may not have considered a change in font size.
</p>
<p>
Some effort has been made to organize the theme resources in such
a way that a "new branding" is possible. For example many selectors
are named based on the components that reference them. CSS style sheets
have been organized as "layout", "colorAndMedia", and "typography".
However there are many implicit dependencies that may result in
undesirable effects if a change is made to only one of these style sheets.
</p>
<p>
It is recommended that theme changes for an application be made as
discussed previously. If a new theme is absolutely required the following
sections will try and descibe how to attempt it.
</p>
<p>
<em><b>Disclaimer: It must be understood that the content of a theme 
is tightly bound to the version of the Woodstock components. No guarantee
can be made that a theme created based on a given version of the 
components can be used WITHOUT MODIFICATION with a later version of 
the components.
</b>
</em>
</p>
<h3><a name="5.1"></a>5.1 Cloning an Existing Theme with themes/build.xml</h3>
<p>
If creating a new theme is absolutely the only means necessary to accomplish
the desired goal then the approach is to clone the base theme defined
in <code>webui-jsf-suntheme.jar</code> and modify files and properties
as necessary. It is highly recommended that only the "skin" be 
modified. This includes only those properties that affect color
and typography. If images need changing then the sizes should be
maintained. Any changes to layout cannot be guaranteed to be effective
unless Java code and or Javascript is adjusted to accommodate the new
layout.
</p>
<p>
The <code>themes/build.xml</code> 
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/index.html">ANT</a>
script can be used to create a clone of the
"suntheme". A clone means that the contents will be exactly the same
as the "suntheme" except that the "suntheme" name will be changed
to the new theme name. All paths will be redefined as well. To configure a
new cloned theme, a properties file is used to specify the
new values. In the following table the properties in bold type must be 
specified in the properties file, and those not in bold type are optional.
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<th>ANT Property</th>
<th>Suntheme value</th>
<th>Description</th>
<tr>

<tr><td>
<b>theme.name</b>
</td><td>
suntheme
</td><td>
The Theme name.<br>
<em>"suntheme" must not be used.</em>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<b>theme.src</b>
</td><td>
src/suntheme
</td><td>
The directory to build when the <code>buildTheme</code> target is used.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<b>theme.clone-src</b>
</td><td>
src/suntheme
</td><td>
The root of the theme resources to clone.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<b>theme.build-dir</b>
</td><td>
build/suntheme
</td><td>
The temporary build destination for theme files.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
theme.l10n-dir
</td><td>
./src/suntheme/translatedFiles
</td><td>
The directory that contains locale dependent resources. The subdirectory
structure reflects the directory structured of src/suntheme with respect
to the resource paths. For example for a "ja" locale there would be
a "messages/messages_ja.properties" file under this directory. Only under
rare circumstances are resources, other than messages.properties localized.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<b>theme.jar</b>
</td><td>
dist/webui-jsf-suntheme.jar
</td><td>
The destination path including the jar name for the theme jar.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<b>theme.version</b>
</td><td>
@THEMEVERSION@
</td><td>
The theme version as reported by the ThemeService implementation. This
value must be the same as the theme that is being cloned.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<b>theme.package</b>
</td><td>
com.sun.webui.jsf.suntheme
</td><td>
The resouce's package path, any paths are derived from this value, i.e
com/sun/webui/jsf/suntheme.<br>
<em>"com.sun.webui.jsf.suntheme" must not be used.</em>
</td><td>

<tr><td>
<b>theme.css-name</b>
</td><td>
_sun4
</td><td>
An identifier that effects a name space for all CSS selectors.<br>
<em>"_sun4" must not be used.</em>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<b>theme.service-class</b>
</td><td>
SunthemeThemeService
</td><td>
The Java class name of the
<a href="theme-infrastructure.html#10.6"><code>ThemeService</code></a>
SPI implementation.<br>
<em><code>SunthemeThemeService</code> must not be used.</em>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
theme.service-class-template
</td><td>
src/suntheme/com/sun/webui/jsf/suntheme/SunthemeThemeService.java
</td><td>
The name of a Java file to use a template to create the implementation
of <a href="theme-infrastructure.html#10.6">
<code>ThemeService</code></a>. 
<code>META-INF/services/SunthemtThemeService.java</code>
is the default template, if this property is not specified.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
theme.service-properties-template
</td><td>
src/suntheme/com/sun/webui/jsf/suntheme/suntheme.properties
</td><td>
The name of the Java ResourceBundle Properties file to use as a 
template that defines the infomation about the theme and is returned
by the <a href="theme-infrastructure.html#10.6"><code>ThemeService</code></a>
implementation. <code>META-INF/services/suntheme.properties</code>
is the default template, if this property is not specified.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<b>theme.clone-dir</b>
</td><td>
No equivialent value.
</td><td>
The destination directory for the root of cloned theme files.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
theme.clone-filter
</td><td>
No equivialent value.
</td><td>
If this value is true the cloned files will be filtered and tokens
will be replaced with values. For example the "@THEME_CSS@" token
in the style sheets will be replaced with the value of
<code>theme.css-name</code> property.
It is not recommended to set this value to true.
Substitution will take place when the theme is built. Leaving the
tokens unresolved in the clone allows comparisons to be made more
easily to new versions of the suntheme, easing the port to a newer theme.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
theme.clone-overwrite
</td><td>
No equivialent value.
</td><td>
If this value is true an existing clone at <code>theme.clone-dir</code>
will be overwriiten when the <code>cloneTheme</code> target is called
with the same properties file in effect. Only files that differ from the
files being cloned will be overwritten. It is advised that this property
be set to false or not specified, to prevent losing edits unintentionally.
</td></tr>

</table>
</p>

<p>
The following is the contents of the
<code>themes/theme-name.properties.sample</code> 
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/index.html">ANT</a> properties file.
<div class="codebox">
<code>
<pre>
<iframe src="references/theme-name.properties.sample" width="100%"
	height="100%" frameborder="0">
</iframe>
</pre>
</code>
</div>
<p>
Once this properties file is created it is named after the 
new theme name with the "properties" suffix. <code>ant</code> is then
invoked with the <code>-D</code> option defining the <code>theme.name</code>
property.
This is a little redundant in that the <code>theme.name</code> 
property in the properties file is technically not necessary. For example
<div class="codebox">
<code>
<pre>
Assume the theme-name.properties.sample properties file was renamed
to "mojave.properties".

% ant -Dtheme.name=mojave cloneTheme buildTheme buildJsTheme

This command will create the clone at "/tmp/theme/src/mojave", build
the theme in "/tmp/theme/build/mojave" and generate the theme jar
/tmp/theme/dist/webui-jsf-mojave.jar.
</pre>
</code>
</div>
Once the clone is created and as long as the <code>mojave.properties</code>
files exists in the appropriate location, the ant command can just be
<div class="codebox">
<code>
<pre>
% ant -Dtheme.name=mojave
</pre>
</code>
</div>
This will just build the theme and produce the theme jar. Note that 
token substititution takes place during a build.
</p>
<h3><a name="5.2"></a>5.2 More than One Theme Jar in WEB-INF/web.xml</h3>
<p>
Theme resources are delivered in a jar file. This requires that the
jar file appear on an application's class path. Since the jar file 
resides in the application's <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory it does
appear on the class path. However there is no specified order of the 
jars that are found on an application's class path.
</p>
<p>
When more than one theme jar file or a component jar file that contains
an implmentation of <code>ThemeService</code> appears on an application's
class path it cannot be determined which theme resources will be in effect
when running the application. The choice is determined by the 
<a href="javadoc/webui/com/sun/webui/theme/ThemeFactory.html">
<code>ThemeFactory</code></a>
implementation. The default implementation is the 
<a href="theme-infrastructure.html#10.5"><code>SPIThemeFactory</code></a>
class. In brief, its policy, when a specific theme is not requested, is
to provide a list of theme resources ordered based on the order of 
responses to its requests for <code>ThemeService</code> SPI. Essentially
the first <code>ThemeService</code> implementation to respond to a call
for this service, becomes the "default" theme and its
resources are used by the Woodstock components. The actual policy is 
a little more involved than this.
See <a href="theme-infrastructure.html#10.5"><code>SPIThemeFactory</code></a>
for more details.
</p>
<p>
However internally in the
<a href="javadoc/webui/com/sun/webui/jsf/theme/ThemeUtilities.html">
<code>ThemeUtilities</code></a> class, used by all Woodstock components, a
specific version is always spefied in calls to <code>getTheme</code>.
(As of this writing it is "@THEMEVERSION@").
Therefore, the first theme that satisfies the version requirement is used
by the components.
</p>

<h1><a name="6"></a>6 Configuring WEB-INF/web.xml</h1>
<p>
Similar to the discussion in <a href="redefining-theme-properties.html#2">
Configuring WEB-INF/web.xml</a> an application can affect the theme
chosen by the <code>SPIThemeFactory</code> and therefore determine the
Theme used by the Woodstock components.
</p>
<h3><a name="6.1">
</a>6.1 The com.sun.webui.theme.DEFAULT_THEME context-param</h3>
<p>
The <code>com.sun.webui.theme.DEFAULT_THEME</code> <code>context-param</code>
is used to define theme preferred theme by name that should be loaded
by the <code>ThemeFactory</code>. The value of this parameter is stored
in the <code>ThemeContext</code> and is referenced by the
<code>ThemeFactory</code> for theme requests that do not explicitly
request a theme name. The Woodstock components do not explicitly specify
a theme name in its calls to <code>getTheme</code>.
</p>
<p>
If an application has the cloned theme "mojave" as produced in
<a href="#5.1">Cloning an Existing Theme with themes/build.xml</a> in 
its <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory it could name that theme as the
"default" theme for its application, as follows
</p>
<div class="codebox">
<code>
<pre>
    &lt;context-param&gt;
	&lt;param-name&gt;com.sun.webui.theme.DEFAULT_THEME&lt;param-name&gt;
	&lt;param-value&gt;mojave&lt;param-value&gt;
    &lt;context-param&gt;
</pre>
</code>
</div>
This would result in the application and the Woodstock components referencing
this theme jar file for theme resource requests.
</p>
