The JavaScript documentation generated by the JsDoc toolkit is based
on the suntheme template. The suntheme template is basically a
duplicate of the "sunny" template provided by default with the JsDoc
toolkit. However, the following features have been overridden.

1. Created our own template in order to override frame width and
splash page.

2. Removed "Defined in" class source links which are incorrectly
generated for subdirectories.

3. Added code to process.js in order to hide private classes from
the main index template. Although, it is fine to show inherited
functions.

Although the JsDoc toolkit comes with a clean version of the Rhino
jar, we shall use the custom jar provided by Dojo. We end up with the
same JavaScript documentation, so there is no need to check in both
sources.

Usage:

java -jar rhino.jar src/app/run.js -t=src/templates/suntheme <files>
