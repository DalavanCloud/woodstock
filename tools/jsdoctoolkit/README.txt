The JavaScript documentation generated by the JsDoc toolkit is based
on the suntheme template. The suntheme template is basically a
duplicate of the "sunny" template provided by default with the JsDoc
toolkit. However, we created our own template in order to override
frame width and the splash page. We also removed "Defined in" class
source links which are incorrectly generated for subdirectories.

Although the JsDoc toolkit comes with a clean version of the Rhino
jar, we shall use the custom jar provided by Dojo. We end up with the
same JavaScript documentation, so there is no need to check in both
sources.

Usage:

java -jar rhino.jar src/app/run.js -t=src/templates/suntheme <files>
