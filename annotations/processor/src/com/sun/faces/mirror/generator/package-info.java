/**
 * Generator classes that write configuration files and source files based on
 * the component and renderer info found during annotation processing.
 *
 * <p>A generator is invoked in three phases. First, the generator's {@code init()}
 * method will be called, and component or renderer info will be passed to the
 * generator. The exact parameters vary from generator to generator. Next, the
 * annotation processor will ask the generator for information about the 
 * configuration or source file to be created, such as its name. Finally, the
 * annotation process will create an appropriate writer to which the file may
 * be written, and call {@code Generator.generate(PrintWriter)}.
